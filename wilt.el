Just displays WILT metric in status line whenever it's configured

When called interactively, toggle `wilt-mode'.  With prefix ARG,
enable `wilt-mode' if ARG is positive, otherwise disable it.

When called from Lisp, enable `wilt-mode' if ARG is omitted,
nil or positive.  If ARG is `toggle', toggle `wilt-mode'.
Otherwise behave as if called interactively.
